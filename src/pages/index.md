      I am a queer, nonbinary devloper living and working in Memphis, TN. This is a blog about some of my work, some of my talks, and some of the some of weird stuff that happens when your job is binary, but you are not. Considering I'm in my last semester of school, this blog will probably be filler for a bit. Sorry.
